# Code Refactor of Horiseon Marketing Webpage

# Description #
 I have refactored the Horiseon marketing agency's webpage to follow accessibility standards by adding alt attributes. I have also refactored the CSS and HTML to meet the additonal acceptance criteria.

The starter code to be refactored was from the Develop folder of the coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram repository on GitHub.

The specific link is https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram and it is located here within my repository.

The listed contributors have GitHub account names Xandromus and Georgeyoo.

Additionally, I was having an issue deploying my application on GitHub pages due to originally forking instead of cloning so I used AskBCS on Sunday 10/01/2023. The chat generated with ask-280700 and I worked out my issue with Tory.
