# Code Refactor of Horiseon Marketing Webpage

Description: I have refactored the Horiseon marketing agency's webpage to follow accessibility standards by adding alt attributes. I have also refactored the CSS and HTML to meet the additonal acceptance criteria.

The starter code to be refactored was from the Develop folder of the coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram repository on GitHub.

The specific link is https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram and it is located here within my repository.

The listed contributors have GitHub account names Xandromus and Georgeyoo.
